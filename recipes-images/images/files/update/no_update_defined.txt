For this machine no directory with the files for the legacy update
procedure was found. So the legacy update image will not be built.

If you inherited your machine.conf from one of the toradex machines for which
the legacy update exists make sure to amend your overrides, e.g. if your
building for a colibri-imx6.conf derived machine add something like this to
your machine.conf file:

MACHINEOVERRIDES .= ":colibri-imx6

alternatively add a directory tree with the needed files for your machine
to:

images/files/<machine>/update/

Note that this must not include a file named no_update_defined.txt!
